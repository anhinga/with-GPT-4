First conversation with GPT-5 thinking about my favorite open math problem:

https://chatgpt.com/share/68978c36-3498-8010-b5e3-05559b5cfba2

It starts with making the same mistake as Aristotle from Harmonic https://aristotle.harmonic.fun/

(For some reason they both decided that the set of fixed points of a Scott-continuous transformation of a powerset is algebraic;
I am not sure what pushes these two very different systems in this particular mistaken direction.)

But at the tail end of the conversation it correctly found a set of examples of the subset of domain E from
page 118 of the PDF file of my dissertation https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03868 (page number 103)
which does not have the least upper bound (and it's the same set of examples I would give (any one of them would do)).

So, yes, some level of competence in higher math is present - nice!
