First conversation with GPT-5 thinking about my favorite open math problem:

It starts with making the same mistake as Aristotle from Harmonic https://aristotle.harmonic.fun/

(For some reason they both decided that the set of fixed points of a Scott-continuous transformation of a powerset is algebraic;
I am not sure what pushes these two very different systems in this particular mistaken direction.)

But at the tail end of the conversation it correctly found an example of the subset of domain E from
page 118 of the PDF file of my dissertation https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03868 (page number 103)
which does not have the least upper bound (and it's the same example I would give).

So, yes, some competence in higher math is present.
