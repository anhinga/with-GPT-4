ME: Please comment on https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13304

GPT-4: (Finished browsing) I'm sorry, but I'm currently having technical difficulties opening the URL you provided. However, I can still try to help if you provide me with some details about the paper. For instance, you could tell me its title, authors, abstract, or any specific parts you're interested in, and I can give my thoughts based on that.

ME, SOMEWHAT LATER: Let's try again. Perhaps the technical difficulties might be transient...

GPT-4: (Finished browsing) I apologize, but it seems the issue persists and I'm unable to open the URL you provided directly. However, there are other ways I can help. If you can share the title, abstract, or some details about the paper, I can provide a commentary based on my training data up until September 2021. Alternatively, I could guide you on how to analyze the paper.

ME: Is that because arxiv. org restricts you from opening that URL?

GPT-4: It's not specifically that arXiv.org is restricting access, but rather it appears to be a technical issue related to how my current capabilities handle certain types of web content. This is not limited to arXiv.org, and can occur with other sites as well. As of my training cut-off in September 2021, I'm not aware of any specific restrictions that arXiv has put in place to block access by AI models like me. I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused. Is there any other way I can assist you with this topic?
