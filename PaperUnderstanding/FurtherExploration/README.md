Let's do several more conversations:

1) Understanding my markdown notes on GitHub (nice retelling):

ME: Would you comment on https://github.com/anhinga/2022-notes/blob/main/Generative-autoregressive-models-are-similators/README.md

GPT-4: This README.md on GitHub is a personal exploration of the concept that generative autoregressive models, like GPT-3, function as simulators. The author posits that these models generate various entities and that users interact with these entities. This perspective suggests that GPT-3 and similar models are not just text generators but can simulate various phenomena, personalities, and situations based on their training data.

The author reflects on their experience with GPT-2 in 2019, noting that the AI appeared to generate a 'virtual personality' based on the initial prompt, which then engaged in a conversation with the user. They suggest that this behavior is akin to a simulation of a personality.

The README.md also highlights the work of "Janus", a contributor to the discussion on this topic. Janus has written on the subject and their work has been publicized and discussed by Scott Alexander, further spreading this viewpoint. The author of the README.md believes that this perspective is becoming more common among organizations working with modern generative Transformers, and sees it as an important step towards better understanding these models.

The author also links to their reading notes and a status update on Janus' Simulator theory, indicating an ongoing interest and engagement with the topic. They see value in the idea of controlling these simulations directly, suggesting that by treating the Simulator theory as literally correct, it might be possible to improve the performance and quality of the simulations run by these models.

Overall, the README.md represents a snapshot of an ongoing exploration into the nature of generative autoregressive models. The author's perspective is that these models are simulators and not just text generators, and that understanding them as such could lead to new insights and improvements in their performance (link to my file).

I am going to try to put the PDF and/or the LaTeX of that RecurrentGPT paper on GitHub, and then we'll see how it goes.

2) Try a PDF again:

ME: Would you comment on https://github.com/anhinga/github-tests/blob/main/copy-of-RecurrentGPT-paper/2305.13304.pdf

GPT-4: I'm sorry, but I'm unable to directly view or comment on the contents of the PDF file from the provided GitHub link because the GitHub interface doesn't allow for direct viewing of PDFs. However, you can download the PDF and summarize or quote a section for me to comment on. Alternatively, you can ask specific questions about the PDF's content, and I can provide responses based on my training knowledge cut-off in September 2021.

OK, I should use a website like GitHub pages instead, because the current version of Web browsing is underpowered and can't download

ME: Would you comment on https://anhinga.github.io/github-pages-tests/2305.13304.pdf

GPT-4: I'm sorry, but I'm currently unable to directly access and analyze PDF files. However, I can certainly help you understand the content if you could provide me with some specific sections or concepts from the document that you're interested in.

So, this is not possible at the moment; I can feed it the LaTeX sections of the paper (which I might as well just copy-paste), and then it might help me to understand
the details.
