I switched web browsing off, and I used the latex source of the paper downloaded from the arxiv.

I asked for help in understanding the central Section 2 of the paper (it's slightly under 2 pages)

ME: Please summarize the following LaTeX section of a paper. \baby means RecurrentGPT: Copy-paste of the LaTeX source of Section 2

GPT-4: The paper describes a language-based recurrent mechanism named "RecurrentGPT" (referred to as "\baby" in the paper). The \baby model uses a large language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT to simulate a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, but through natural language. The model operates by translating all vector-based components typically found in an LSTM (input vectors, output vectors, hidden states, cell states) into natural language equivalents.

The \baby model is formally defined as a computational function parameterized by an LLM and a prompt template. Unlike conventional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), \baby generates its input and output separately, using natural language prompts to mimic recurrent computation. The paper goes on to explain the language-based building blocks of the \baby model and how it achieves recurrent computation through prompt engineering.

The model utilizes "language-based building blocks," which include an input/output system and a Long-Short Term Memory mechanism. The input/output system, referred to as "content" and "plan," is akin to an outline of text to be generated (plan) and the generated text (content). The model also incorporates a long-term memory mechanism, which stores previously generated content using a VectorDB approach, allowing the model to store more information than memory-based Transformers. The short-term memory is a brief paragraph summarizing recent steps, intended to maintain coherence in the generated content.

For its recurrent computation, the \baby model relies on a prompt template and some Python code to mimic the recurrent computation scheme of RNNs. The model constructs input prompts by filling the prompt template with input content/plan and its internal long-short term memory. It also has a built-in feature to encourage diversity in output and interactivity by generating multiple plans, allowing human users to select or write the most suitable plan.

Lastly, the paper discusses how the \baby model supports interactive long text generation. It suggests that the model provides advantages over conventional computer-assisted writing systems, such as reducing human labor, offering interpretability and interactivity, and allowing for customization. The interaction with users also helps to correct potential mistakes made by the model, preventing error propagation, which is a significant challenge for long text generation.
