The model made 3 attempts, the third one was successful. The model used Bing search and found https://paperswithcode.com/paper/recurrentgpt-interactive-generation-of and was able to understand it and talk about it, at least to some extent.

I'm sorry for the inconvenience. I seem to be having trouble accessing the paper directly from arXiv as well. However, I was able to gather some information from the search results. The paper appears to be titled "RecurrentGPT: Interactive Generation of (Arbitrarily) Long Text." From the brief description available, it seems that the paper introduces RecurrentGPT, a model that simulates the recurrence mechanism found in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). This mechanism is used to overcome a limitation in GPT models, which can struggle to generate arbitrarily long text due to their fixed-size context. RecurrentGPT is built upon a Large Language Model (LLM) such as ChatGPT.

Let's try searching for more information or a summary of this paper to provide a more detailed comment.

The paper "RecurrentGPT: Interactive Generation of (Arbitrarily) Long Text" by Wangchunshu Zhou, Yuchen Eleanor Jiang, Peng Cui, Tiannan Wang, Zhenxin Xiao, Yifan Hou, Ryan Cotterell, and Mrinmaya Sachan proposes a novel approach to address a key limitation of GPT models: the inability to generate arbitrarily long text due to their fixed-size context.

In the paper, the authors introduce RecurrentGPT, which utilizes a language-based simulation of the recurrence mechanism found in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). This model builds upon a Large Language Model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, and simulates the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) mechanism in a language-based format.
 
RecurrentGPT operates by generating a paragraph of text at each timestep and updating its language-based long-short term memory, which is stored on the hard drive, as well as the prompt. This allows RecurrentGPT to generate texts of arbitrary length without forgetting any of the context. Moreover, since these language-based memories can be observed and edited by users, RecurrentGPT is interpretable and allows for interactive generation of long text. This makes it a step towards next-generation computer-assisted writing systems that go beyond local editing suggestions.

An interesting aspect of RecurrentGPT is its proposed usage as an interactive fiction that directly interacts with consumers, a concept the authors term as "AI As Contents" (AIAC). The authors believe AIAC to be the next form of conventional AI-generated content (AIGC). They also suggest the possibility of using RecurrentGPT to create personalized interactive fiction that directly interacts with readers instead of writers.

In a broader context, RecurrentGPT exemplifies the usefulness of borrowing ideas from popular model designs in cognitive science and deep learning to enhance the capabilities of LLMs. The authors have made their code available for further exploration and also provide an online demo of RecurrentGPT [papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/recurrentgpt-interactive-generation-of).
