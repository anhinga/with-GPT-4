Hi! How do I define a continuous dcpo in Lean theorem prover?

GPT-4:

Lean is a powerful theorem prover and programming language based on dependent type theory. In order to define a continuous directed complete partial order (dcpo) in Lean, you'll need to define the required structures and properties.

A continuous dcpo is a poset that is directed complete, meaning every directed subset has a supremum, and it's continuous, meaning that for every element, its supremum of directed subsets that are way-below it (written x << y) is equal to itself.

Here's a step-by-step guide to defining a continuous dcpo in Lean:

1. Import required libraries:
    
```lean
import order.complete_lattice
import order.directed
```
