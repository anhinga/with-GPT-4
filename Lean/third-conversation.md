ME:

Hi! I'd like to generate Lean definition of Alexandrov open set. The LaTeX definition is Consider dcpo $(A, \sqsubseteq_{A})$ and $U \subseteq A$.
$U$ is {\em Aleksandrov open} if $\forall x, y \in A.
\ x \in U, x \sqsubseteq y \Rightarrow y \in U$.

GPT-4:

Hello! I'd be happy to help you create a Lean definition for Alexandrov open sets. Below is the definition in Lean:

```lean
import order.bounded_lattice

universes u

variables {A : Type u} [dcpo : partial_order A]
include dcpo

def alexandrov_open (U : set A) : Prop :=
  ∀ (x y : A), x ∈ U → x ≤ y → y ∈ U
```

Here, we first import the necessary module `order.bounded_lattice` which contains the definition of `partial_order`. We then declare a universe `u` and create a variable `A` of that universe. We also create a variable `dcpo` which is an instance of a `partial_order` on `A`. We include `dcpo` in the definition to make sure the partial order is available for the rest of the definition.

Finally, we define alexandrov_open as a function that takes a set `U` of type set `A` and returns a proposition. The proposition states that for all elements `x` and `y` in `A`, if `x` is in `U` and `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then `y` must also be in `U`.

NOTE:

The result is meh, to say the least, and yet it helps me to write the correct version:

```lean
def is_alexandrov_open {A : Type*} [complete_lattice A] (B : set A) : Prop :=
  ∀ x : A, ∀ y : A , x ∈ B → x ≤ y → y ∈ B
```
