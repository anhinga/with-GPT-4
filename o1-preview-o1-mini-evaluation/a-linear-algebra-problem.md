"Hi, could you construct an example of a 4 by 4 matrix A, such that A squared is a zero matrix, A has rank 2, and
all elements of A are non-zero?"

**GPT-4o:** does not find the answer, but after being asked to use Python to verify rank and the result of matrix multiplication it understands that things are wrong, makes a few attempts to fix them, but does not find a correct answer. However, it understands that it has not found a correct answer yet:

(Generally speaking, asking the model to generate and run code immediately makes it much smarter.)

**o1-mini:** thinks for a really long time (for over 2 minutes, the log of the summary of its internal thinking is really long), does tons of things with this, finally proposes a couple of answers, understands, that they are both incorrect, and makes a conjecture that a real-values matrix with these conditions might not exist, and asks me, whether I'd like to try to construct a complex-valued matrix with these properties:

**o1-preview:** thinks for a really long time (a minute and a half), the log of the summary of its internal thinking is really long), tnen it does something cool. First, it figures out the correct Jordan form for this task. Then it say, let's find a sufficiently non-trivial invertible transformation, and that will probably be it. Being a lazy one, it writes a formula for the proposed solution, but does not double-check that all elements are non-zero:

But yes, the answer it gives seems to be correct.

Consider

P =

array([[ 1, 1, 1, 1],

[ 1, 2, 3, 4],

[ 1, 3, 6, 10],

[ 1, 4, 10, 20]])

and

A =

array([[0, 1, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 0],

[0, 0, 0, 1],

[0, 0, 0, 0]])

it says that the answer is P-inverted multiplied by A multiplied by P

Indeed if I compute that formula the resulting matrix is

array([[ 8., 24., 52., 96.],

[ -17., -56., -128., -244.],

[ 14., 48., 112., 216.],

[ -4., -14., -33., -64.]])

and it satisfies the conditions.
