# Highlights of my GPT-4 experiences: March-October 2023

GPT-4 has been introduced to the public on March 14:

As we are looking forward towards the DevDay on November 6, this is a good moment to review
highlights of my experiences with GPT-4.

I start to work with GPT-4 on March 21: [March-21-conversation.md](March-21-conversation.md) (this includes competent conversion from Markdown to LaTeX)

March 25: GPT-4 demonstrates remarkable ability to understand uncommented and rather non-standard computer code (200+ lines in Julia):

GPT-4 correctly figures out that I am using nested dictionaries representing vectors and correctly infers
that "the main idea of this program is to implement a neural network-like engine using nested dictionaries 
and custom-defined mathematical operations, allowing for flexible and extensible data processing".

April 20: GPT-4 demonstrates competence in using some custom-defined syntax I just invented. So I can use
my own syntax without the need to implement any macros or parsing:
