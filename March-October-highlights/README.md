# Highlights of my GPT-4 experiences: March-October 2023

GPT-4 has been introduced to the public on March 14:

"GPT-4 Developer Livestream" by Greg Brockman, 24 min video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=outcGtbnMuQ

As we are looking forward towards the DevDay on November 6, this is a good moment to review
highlights of my experiences with GPT-4.

I start to work with GPT-4 on March 21: [March-21-conversation.md](March-21-conversation.md) (this includes competent conversion from Markdown to LaTeX)

March 25: GPT-4 demonstrates remarkable ability to understand uncommented and rather non-standard computer code (200+ lines in Julia):

GPT-4 correctly figures out that I am using nested dictionaries representing vectors and correctly infers
that "the main idea of this program is to implement a neural network-like engine using nested dictionaries 
and custom-defined mathematical operations, allowing for flexible and extensible data processing".

April 15-17:

I ask GPT-4 to creatively modify my interactive shaders, and, in one instance, to remix my shader with someone's else
shader and then to improve the resulting remix. The results are quite impressive, especially given
that the system does not have a chance to visually inspect the animations generated by shaders
(something human programmers take advantage of):

This one is particularly interesting:

April 20: GPT-4 demonstrates competence in using some custom-defined syntax I just invented. So I can use
my own syntax without the need to implement any macros or parsing:

## With Code Interpreter

The next interesting thing happens soon after Code Interpreter mode is introduced.

This mode (now called Advanced Data Analysis) allows the model to execute Python code it generates
(and also allows the user to upload files to be processed by generated code).

It is a big boost in capabilities (some people even suggested using GPT-4.5 name for this one).

July 11: https://chat.openai.com/share/d1c4c289-9907-46a6-8ac1-f6baa34f1b12

ME: "Someone is asking: What is the largest natural number that is the product of natural numbers that add up to 1976?"

GPT-4: (reasons about the task, generates code and runs it to solve the problem)

ME: "Thanks! This is quite awesome. This is a really large number. Imagine a human trying to solve this problem with access to a computer or a calculator, just with paper and pencil. How would such a human calculate an estimate of this number, say, the first 3 digits and the order of magnitude."

GPT-4: (explains how to use logarithms for that, then generates code and runs it to obtain the result)
