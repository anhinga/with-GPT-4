# With GPT 4

I am exploring GPT-4 in recent weeks, and my collaboration with GPT-4 started to generate working code in recent days.

I have been sharing bits and pieces of my GPT-4 explorations here and there, but it's convenient to have a dedicated repository.

[Shadertoy](Shadertoy) - working with GPT-4 and shaders

[Lean](Lean) - work related to Lean theorem prover

[PaperUnderstanding](PaperUnderstanding) - help me to understand what a paper is about (Web browsing mode)

[modeling-dialog-between-scientists](modeling-dialog-between-scientists) - modeling a possible dialog between two scientists

[March-September-highlights](March-September-highlights) - **highlights of the first 6 months of my GPT-4 use**, Mar-Sep 2023

[continuous-geometry](continuous-geometry) - an exploration related to continuous geometry (introduced by von Neumann)
