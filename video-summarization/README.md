I wanted to summarize an interview with Michael Levin conducted by Carlos Perez:

My first attempt was to say

>Hi! Carlos Perez says about his interview with Michael Levin:
"Watch Michael Levin's explanation of life's ratchet and the future of civilization with AGI agents."
>
>Below is a transcript of that interview. I'd like to ask you to summarize Michael Levin's thoughts about
"the future of civilization with AGI agents".

and to paste the copy of the autogenerated YouTube transcript, but that was too long.

What I have done instead, I have set _custom instructions_ as follows:

INSERT

and then I have ask to comment to parts of the transcript one after one:
