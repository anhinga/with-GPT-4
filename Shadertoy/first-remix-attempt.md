I asked the system to explain the shader https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XsXXDn to me, 
and then to remix it with my shader https://www.shadertoy.com/view/mdVSWV

The explanation, unfortunately, did not clarify much (I still don't know how that first shader works), 
but the remix was fine (although it lost the interactive elements from my shader (NO, I AM WRONG HERE, IT IS INTERACTIVE), and it has too much white,
but it does look like a genuine remix): https://www.shadertoy.com/view/DdyXWt

So, I asked it to fix the (incorrectly perceived by me) lack of interativity and to fix the too much white, and it produced an awesome shader:

This site was having problems during the last hour. I am opening a new tab to see if you can talk...

Hello! It seems like you're able to communicate with me now. How can I help you today? If you have any questions or need assistance, please feel free to ask.

ME:

Great! I wonder how the following shader by Danilo Guanabara works:

```
#define t iTime
#define r iResolution.xy

void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord ){
	vec3 c;
	float l,z=t;
	for(int i=0;i<3;i++) {
		vec2 uv,p=fragCoord.xy/r;
		uv=p;
		p-=.5;
		p.x*=r.x/r.y;
		z+=.07;
		l=length(p);
		uv+=p/l*(sin(z)+1.)*abs(sin(l*9.-z-z));
		c[i]=.01/length(mod(uv,1.)-.5);
	}
	fragColor=vec4(c/l,t);
}
```

GPT-4:

This is a fragment shader written in the GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language). It is used to create visual effects on the GPU by manipulating pixel colors on the screen. Let me explain how this specific shader works:

    1. The shader defines two macros at the beginning:
        `t`: Represents the time passed since the shader started, which allows for animation.
        `r`: Represents the resolution of the output screen (width and height).

    2. The `mainImage` function is the entry point of the shader. It takes two arguments:
        `out vec4 fragColor`: The output color of the pixel at the current fragment coordinate.
        `in vec2 fragCoord`: The input fragment coordinate.

    3. Inside the `mainImage` function, a `vec3 c` variable is declared to store the color channels (red, green, and blue).

    4. The variable `float l` is declared to store the length of the vector `p`, and `float z` is initialized with the value of `t`.

    5. A for loop iterates three times (once for each color channel). For each iteration:
        `vec2 uv` is declared to store the texture coordinates.
        `vec2 p` is initialized as the normalized fragment coordinate (0 to 1 range).
        `p` is shifted by 0.5, making it range from -0.5 to 0.5.
        `p.x` is scaled by the aspect ratio of the screen (width/height).
        `z` is incremented by 0.07.
        `l` is assigned the length of the `p` vector.
        A distortion effect is applied to the `uv` coordinates based on `l` and `z`.
        The current color channel is assigned a value based on the distance to the center of a repeating pattern.

    6. Finally, the `fragColor` is set as the result of the color channels divided by `l`, and the time value is used as the alpha channel.

The overall effect of this shader is an animated, wavy pattern with colors that change over time, creating a visually interesting and dynamic output.

ME:

Thanks! Would you remix the motifs of that shader with the following shader:

```
float fract_sin_dot(vec2 uv) {
    return fract(sin(dot(
        vec2(sin(3. * uv.x) * cos(4. * uv.y), sin(8. * uv.y) * cos(5. * uv.x)),
        0.1 * iMouse.xy + vec2(1.0, 1.0))) *
        4. + 0.5 * iTime);
}

void mainImage(out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord) {
    vec2 uv = fragCoord / iResolution.xy;

    vec3 color = vec3(fract_sin_dot(uv),
                      fract_sin_dot(uv + vec2(0.1, 0.2)),
                      fract_sin_dot(vec2(sin(3. * uv.x), uv.y)));

    fragColor = vec4(color, 1.0);
}

```

GPT-4:

Sure! Here's a shader that combines elements from both shaders. The new shader creates an animated, wavy pattern with colors that change over time, influenced by the `fract_sin_dot` function from the second shader:

```glsl
#define t iTime
#define r iResolution.xy

float fract_sin_dot(vec2 uv) {
    return fract(sin(dot(
        vec2(sin(3. * uv.x) * cos(4. * uv.y), sin(8. * uv.y) * cos(5. * uv.x)),
        0.1 * iMouse.xy + vec2(1.0, 1.0))) *
        4. + 0.5 * t);
}

void mainImage(out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord) {
    vec3 c;
    float l, z = t;
    vec2 fragNorm = fragCoord / r;

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        vec2 uv, p = fragNorm;
        uv = p;
        p -= 0.5;
        p.x *= r.x / r.y;
        z += 0.07;
        l = length(p);
        uv += p / l * (sin(z) + 1.) * abs(sin(l * 9. - z - z));
        c[i] = fract_sin_dot(uv + vec2(float(i) * 0.1, float(i) * 0.2));
    }

    fragColor = vec4(c / l, 1.0);
}
```

Here's what I've done:

    1. I've included the `fract_sin_dot` function from the second shader, which creates a color based on the input coordinates, `iMouse.xy`, and `iTime`.

    2. In the `mainImage` function, instead of calculating the color channels based on the distance to the center of a repeating pattern, I've replaced it with the `fract_sin_dot` function. I've added an offset to the input coordinates for each channel to create the final color.

The result is a shader that combines the wavy distortion effect from the first shader with the colorful pattern generated by the `fract_sin_dot` function from the second shader.

ME:

Great, thanks! Could you make it sensitive to mouse in the manner in which the second shader is sensitive to mouse, and I'd like to see less white, especially in the middle...

GPT-4:

Sure! I've made the following modifications to the combined shader to make it sensitive to the mouse position and reduce the amount of white, especially in the middle:

```glsl
#define t iTime
#define r iResolution.xy

float fract_sin_dot(vec2 uv, vec2 mouse) {
    return fract(sin(dot(
        vec2(sin(3. * uv.x) * cos(4. * uv.y), sin(8. * uv.y) * cos(5. * uv.x)),
        0.1 * mouse + vec2(1.0, 1.0))) *
        4. + 0.5 * t);
}

void mainImage(out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord) {
    vec3 c;
    float l, z = t;
    vec2 fragNorm = fragCoord / r;
    vec2 mouseNorm = iMouse.xy / r;

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        vec2 uv, p = fragNorm;
        uv = p;
        p -= 0.5;
        p.x *= r.x / r.y;
        z += 0.07;
        l = length(p);
        uv += p / l * (sin(z) + 1.) * abs(sin(l * 9. - z - z));
        c[i] = fract_sin_dot(uv + vec2(float(i) * 0.1, float(i) * 0.2), mouseNorm);
    }

    fragColor = vec4(c / (l + 0.5), 1.0);
}
```

Here are the changes I've made:

    1. I've modified the `fract_sin_dot` function to take an additional `vec2 mouse` parameter. This parameter represents the normalized mouse position and will be used to control the color pattern based on the mouse position.

    2. In the `mainImage` function, I've calculated the normalized mouse position using `vec2 mouseNorm = iMouse.xy / r;`.

    3. When calling the `fract_sin_dot` function, I've passed the `mouseNorm` variable as the second parameter, making the color pattern sensitive to the mouse position.

    4. To reduce the amount of white in the middle, I've changed the final color calculation from `vec4(c / l, 1.0)` to `vec4(c / (l + 0.5), 1.0)`. This addition of 0.5 to the denominator helps decrease the intensity of the colors, making the white areas less dominant.

With these changes, the shader now reacts to the mouse position, and the white areas in the middle are less prominent.
