I am trying to understand the hidden magic of von Neumann algebras: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_algebra

Question 1: Hi, do you know what's the philosophy of von Neumann algebras? What might be the deep reason for people to think von Neumann algebras are quite fruitful?

Question 2: Thanks! I have a more specialized question. Are there deep connections between von Neumann algebras and sheaves?
