## Continuous Cohomology for Geometries

**ME:**

Hi, there is this interesting theory of continuous geometry invented by von  Neumann. I wonder what an appropriate theory of cohomology should be for such spaces. The cohomology rings should probably be indexed by reals and not by integers. So, it seems, one would want some continuous version of the notion of co-chain complex where movement along the complex increases the dimension gradually, and not in increments of 1.

**GPT-4:**

Your question touches on a deep and fascinating intersection of algebraic topology, functional analysis, and operator algebras, particularly through von Neumann's invention of continuous geometries. Continuous geometries are a generalization of projective geometries, characterized by a lattice structure that allows for a continuum of dimensions, in contrast to discrete steps in traditional geometries. This continuous aspect indeed suggests that the corresponding theory of cohomology would not neatly fit into the usual framework of cohomology theories, which are typically indexed by integers, corresponding to discrete dimensions in chain complexes.

In traditional algebraic topology, cohomology theories such as singular cohomology, de Rham cohomology, or Čech cohomology are powerful tools for studying the properties of topological spaces, with cochain complexes playing a central role. These complexes consist of groups or modules indexed by integers, with differential operators mapping between consecutive dimensions.

For continuous geometries, adapting cohomology to account for the continuous transition between dimensions requires rethinking the foundational elements of cohomology:

   1. **Continuous Indexing:** Instead of integer indexing, one would need a framework where the indices are real numbers, reflecting the continuous nature of dimension in continuous geometries. This could potentially involve defining cochains, cocycles, and coboundaries in a way that allows for a "smooth" or continuous variation in dimension.

   2. **Differential Operators:** The differential operators that map between different dimensions in a chain complex would need to be redefined. Instead of mapping between discrete dimensions (n to n+1), these operators would need to facilitate transitions across a continuum of dimensions, possibly requiring the use of calculus or analysis in a more fundamental way than in traditional cohomology.

   3. **Topological and Analytical Tools:** Given the continuous structure of such spaces, tools from analysis and differential geometry might be more appropriate for constructing and analyzing these cohomological structures. For example, concepts from functional analysis and operator algebras, particularly those related to von Neumann algebras, might provide a natural language for describing these continuous transitions.

   4. **New Cohomological Invariants:** The invariants derived from such a cohomology theory would likely be fundamentally different from those in discrete settings, possibly involving new types of algebraic structures that can capture the nuances of continuous geometries.

Developing a cohomology theory for continuous geometries poses significant challenges but also offers the potential for deep insights into the nature of these spaces and their connections to other areas of mathematics. Such a theory would likely draw upon and contribute to various fields, including algebraic topology, functional analysis, and operator algebras, and could have implications for understanding the topology and geometry of spaces that arise in quantum physics and other areas.

As of my last update, a comprehensive cohomology theory for continuous geometries that fits these criteria had not been established. However, the intersection of mathematical fields involved suggests that progress in this area could be both feasible and highly fruitful, requiring innovative approaches that blend discrete and continuous mathematical theories.

**ME:**

Thanks, that's my understanding too. I have a related question. Another place with plenty of discrete diagrams (just like we have discrete diagrams in the traditional co-chains) is category theory, and its various flavors, variations, and generalizations. I wonder if there are known situations in some flavors of category theory or some related topics, where discrete diagrams are continualized, so that the transition along the edges of a diagram is gradual in some sense.

**GPT-4:**

Indeed, the idea of "continualizing" discrete structures extends into the realm of category theory as well, where diagrams play a crucial role in defining morphisms between objects and their relationships. Traditional category theory operates with discrete objects and morphisms, but there have been several developments aimed at introducing continuity or smooth structures into categorical frameworks. These efforts often intersect with the study of topological and differential structures, leading to the creation of categories that accommodate continuous transitions. Here are a few key areas where such ideas have been explored:

### 1. Topological and Smooth Categories

  * __Topological Categories:__ Categories enriched over topological spaces (Top-enriched categories) consider morphisms that are continuous maps between topological spaces. This allows for the study of continuous transformations within a categorical framework.
      
  * __Smooth Categories:__ Similar to topological categories, smooth categories involve smooth manifolds as objects and smooth maps as morphisms. Differential graded categories are an example, particularly relevant in the context of differential geometry and algebraic topology.

### 2. Homotopy Theory and Higher Categories

  * __∞-Categories (Infinity Categories):__ These generalize traditional categories by allowing morphisms between morphisms ad infinitum, with coherence conditions that weaken as you move up. This structure can be seen as a way to continuous diagrams, where transitions between objects can be mediated through an infinite hierarchy of morphisms, capturing a form of continuous transformation through higher-dimensional paths.

  * __Homotopy Theory:__ Particularly through the lens of model categories and ∞-categories, homotopy theory offers a way to "continualize" the notion of equivalence between objects, focusing on paths and homotopies that provide a continuous way to deform one object into another.

### 3. Derived and Spectral Categories

  * __Derived Categories:__ In algebraic geometry and algebraic topology, derived categories allow for the construction of objects that encapsulate complex structures of morphisms, effectively "smoothing out" discrete jumps in cohomological dimensions.
    
  * __Spectral Categories:__ These are categories enriched over spectra, which are stable homotopy theoretic objects. Spectral categories can be seen as providing a framework for continuous diagrams in the context of stable homotopy theory, where morphisms represent not just single maps but potentially continuous families of maps.

### 4. Continuous Categories and Categorical Logic

  * __Continuous Categories:__ There have been efforts to define categories where the hom-sets themselves carry a topology or a smooth structure, making the act of composition a continuous or smooth operation. This can be seen as a direct way to introduce continuous transitions within the categorical structure itself.

  * __Categorical Logic:__ In the context of topos theory and categorical logic, the notion of internal categories within a topos can lead to structures that resemble continuous transformations, especially in topoi that model smooth or continuous spaces.

### 5. Quantum Categories

  * __Quantum Categories:__ In the study of quantum algebra and quantum groups, categories that capture the essence of quantum mechanical systems often employ structures that can be seen as continuous in a non-traditional sense, involving non-commutative geometry and operator algebras.

These areas represent efforts to bridge the discrete-continuous divide in various branches of mathematics, utilizing category theory's flexible framework. The challenge and beauty of these efforts lie in capturing the essence of continuity—whether topological, smooth, or homotopical—within structures traditionally governed by discrete mathematics. Each of these approaches provides a unique perspective on how to conceptualize and work with continuous transitions in mathematical structures, offering rich avenues for research and application.

**ME:**

Yes, most of this seem to be about continuous hom-sets, rather than making arrows in diagrams continuous. But perhaps some of these might be useful when one is looking for ways to make arrows themselves to be continuous in the sense of moving along the arrow (arrow being indefinitely subdividable - yes, this does remind me of continuous Scott domains and such). But among what you said, the following phrase is particularly interesting: 'In algebraic geometry and algebraic topology, derived categories allow for the construction of objects that encapsulate complex structures of morphisms, effectively "smoothing out" discrete jumps in cohomological dimensions.'. Yes, this seems to be very close to what we want, we want to smooth out discrete jumps in cohomological dimensions.

**GPT-4:**

Indeed, your focus on smoothing out discrete jumps in cohomological dimensions aligns well with the conceptual underpinnings of derived categories in algebraic geometry and algebraic topology. Derived categories offer a powerful framework for dealing with complex structures of morphisms that, in a sense, allow for a continuous transition between different levels of structure, albeit within an inherently algebraic context. This "smoothing out" is achieved not through the literal continuous subdivision of arrows but by abstracting away the discrete steps into a more fluid, interconnected web of relationships between objects.

### Understanding Derived Categories

Derived categories are constructed from chain complexes of objects in an abelian category (such as modules over a ring, sheaves of abelian groups, etc.), where the morphisms are not just single arrows but complexes of morphisms that can be composed, leading to a richer structure. The homological nature of these categories provides a way to deal with extensions, deformations, and connections between objects that would be discrete and disjoint in a simpler categorical setting.

### Smoothing Out Discrete Jumps

The key to "smoothing out" in derived categories comes from the way they handle morphisms and equivalences:

  * __Quasi-isomorphisms:__ These are morphisms of chain complexes that induce isomorphisms on all cohomology groups. In the derived category, two objects can be considered equivalent if there is a chain of quasi-isomorphisms connecting them, even if there are no direct morphisms in the original category that relate them. This effectively creates a "continuum" of equivalences where discrete jumps in cohomological dimensions are bridged by considering the derived cohomological properties.

  * __Triangulated Structure:__ Derived categories have a triangulated structure that includes the notion of exact triangles, analogous to short exact sequences. This structure facilitates the handling of extensions and the passage between different cohomological dimensions in a way that abstracts and smooths out the transitions between them.

### Continuous Scott Domains and Derived Categories

The comparison to continuous Scott domains is apt, as both concepts deal with "spaces" (whether in domain theory or algebraic topology) that allow for a form of continuous approximation or transition. In Scott domains, the idea of directed completeness and the ability to approximate elements by directed sets mirrors, in a very abstract sense, the way derived categories allow for the approximation of objects by complexes of morphisms and the passage between different "levels" or dimensions of structure.

### Application and Implications

The framework of derived categories and the tools they provide for "smoothing out" transitions between cohomological dimensions can be incredibly useful in studying continuous geometries or continuous transitions in category theory. By abstracting the discrete steps into a framework that focuses on relationships and equivalences defined by morphisms (and complexes of morphisms), derived categories offer a way to conceptualize continuity in a setting that traditionally relies on discrete constructs.

This approach, while algebraic and homological in nature, provides a powerful analogy for thinking about continuous transformations in more general mathematical contexts, suggesting ways to extend these ideas beyond the confines of algebraic topology and geometry into broader areas of mathematics where the continuum plays a crucial role.
